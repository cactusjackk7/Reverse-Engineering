Reverse Engineering scripts

when referring to computer science/programming, reverse engineering means to "break down" the programming code. Reverse engineering involves finding out how various functions in the code are built, what they do, and how each relates to and interacts with other code functions. Generally speaking, the purpose is to fix errors in the software engineer's code, or create a program like the one being deconstructed.
